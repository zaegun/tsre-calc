# TSRE Calculator

This is a simple project to test out React and TypeScript principles in a Calculator app.

## Purpose

This started because I want a calculator app for my iPad. I didn't need anything complex, so I decided a simple web app should suffice.

## Goals

* Phase 1 (Current):
** Get basic calculator and history functionality working.
** History will only appear in landscape mode.
** Should work in offline
* Phase 2:
** Add a History slide out in portrait mode.
** Fix remaining responsive issues.
* Phase 3: 
** Add additional function buttons in landscape mode. See iOS calculator (landscape mode) for a reference.
* Phase 4:
** Add additional themes

## Note
While I am using the iOS Calculator app as a reference, this project won't be an exact copy. I just needed a starting point.

## Technology

* [React](https://reactjs.org/).
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
